      <p>Young people are smarter than adults give them credit for.  This generation of young people don't even remember life without microwaves, cell phones, and video games. In fact, for them there was no life without these conveniences.  Their brains are sharper than ours were, which can be understood from the concept of having a growth mindset. </p>

      <p>These days there is virtually no excuse to be uneducated, because there are unlimited resources for learning anything you want to know online.  Youtube alone is a source of knowledge that exceeds an Ivy League college education.  You couldn't learn all there is to learn online in several lifetimes.  Even if you wanted to.</p>

      <p>You have to want it.  Not "kind of want it". Not "well, my mom wants it".  Not "I should want it".  Not "everyone else seems to like it."  It has to be a burning desire in your mind and heart.  It has to be something that you love so much or desire so much, you would be willing to do it for free.  In fact, it has to be something that you already do for free.</p>
